    Paul Opel
    I’m a Web Designer/Developer who enjoys using both the left and right parts of the brain to create websites.
    I’ve been working in the industry for almost 25 years, from advertising agencies to multi-national corporations to universities. Currently I am a Web Design Specialist with Onondaga County, NY. Along the way I’ve also worked as a freelance developer, helping small businesses, non-profit organizations, musicians, and others manage their online presence and social media.
    I’m also a musician, playing bass with the band Master Thieves. Our most recent EP “Wanderlust” was released in December 2022 and received a Syracuse Area Music Awards (SAMMY) nomination for best Jam Band Recording.
    I graduated with a B.S. in Education with a K-12 Music Concentration and worked as a music teacher for two years before trying my hand as a professional musician for several years.
