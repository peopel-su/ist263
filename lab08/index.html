    <h1>Professor Paul Opel - Bio</h1>
    <p>I’m a Web Designer/Developer who enjoys using both the left and right parts of the brain to create websites.</p>
    <p>I’ve been working in the industry for almost 25 years, from advertising agencies to multi-national corporations
        to universities. Currently I am a Web Design Specialist with Onondaga County, NY. Along the way I’ve also worked
        as a freelance developer, helping small businesses, non-profit organizations, musicians, and others manage their
        online presence and social media.</p>
    <p>I’m also a musician, playing bass with the band <strong>Master Thieves</strong>. Our most recent EP “Wanderlust”
        was released in December 2022 and received a Syracuse Area Music Awards (SAMMY) nomination for best Jam Band
        Recording.</p>
    <p>I graduated with a B.S. in Education with a K-12 Music Concentration and worked as a music teacher for two years
        before trying my hand as a professional musician for several years.</p>
